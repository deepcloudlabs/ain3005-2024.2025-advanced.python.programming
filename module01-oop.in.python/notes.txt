Modeling/Abstraction
Domain Modeling -> Object-Oriented Programming -> Class + Object
Class -> Concept
Banking Domain -> Account: i. static members: iban, balance, status, ...
                          ii. dynamic members: behaviours -> deposit, withdraw, ...

Real World/Domain --> Domain Expert (Mental Model) -- OO --> Analyst, Architect, Developer, Tester, ...
Domain-Driven Design: Bounded-Context, Ubiquitous Language
Event Storming
Class --> Object

Object-Oriented Programming
1. Class/Object: Encapsulation + Information Hiding ✔
2. Inheritance : Reusability ✔
3. Polymorphism: Agility
